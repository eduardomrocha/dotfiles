- Authentication/authorization flaws
- Cryptographic issues
- Input validation vulnerabilities
- Race conditions and TOCTOU bugs
- Dependency vulnerabilities

‚ö° **Performance Optimization**
- Algorithm complexity (O(n¬≤) ‚Üí O(n log n))
- Database query optimization
- Memory leaks and inefficient allocations
- Caching strategies
- Network I/O optimization

üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Review**
